BUSINESS QUESTIONS

What was the unemployment rate during major economic events (2008 financial crisis, COVID-19 pandemic)?
The peak unemployment rate during the financial crisis reached 10.0% in October 2009. This spike followed 
the collapse of major financial institutions and the global economic downturn.
The unemployment rate surged to a historic high of 14.8% in April 2020, the highest in the dataset. 
This sharp increase was driven by widespread lockdowns and business closures at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic

The 1990s were the most stable decade in terms of unemployment, with a standard deviation of just 1.049

What’s the trend in unemployment over the last 10 years?
Over the past decade (from 2015 to the most recent data point), the unemployment rate decreased from 5.28% to 4.12%. 
While there was a sharp temporary spike in 2020 due to COVID-19, the overall long-term trend shows a gradual
recovery and improvement in the labor market

Conclusion
Understanding unemployment trends is incredibly useful for making smart business decisions. 
Our analysis shows how unemployment responds during major events like the 2008 financial crisis and 
the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, the sharp spike to 14.8% in April 2020 reflects a period when 
businesses faced massive disruptions — fewer people working meant less consumer spending, more caution
in hiring, and higher financial risk. On the other hand, the steady decline from 5.7% in 2015 to 4.1% 
in 2025 suggests a stronger job market and growing economic confidence, which can encourage companies 
to expand operations, invest in growth, or launch new products. The 1990s stood out as a particularly 
stable decade, which can help businesses plan more confidently during similar economic conditions. In 
short, tracking unemployment helps companies with workforce planning, predicting market demand, and assessing
economic risks — all of which are crucial for staying competitive and making well-timed strategic moves
